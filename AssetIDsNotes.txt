The internal file naming conventions for textures and root bone nodes refer to an internal numbering system.
This asset number is made up of a base species index, followed by a form index.

For the first 5 gens, the species ID matches the respective national dex no. (These models being created long after the designs were finalised, and first used in the 'Pokédex 3D' and 'Pokédex 3D Pro' apps.)
i.e Bulbasaur is pm0001, Genesect is pm0649.
For later gens, this ID is different from the corresponding national dex no. and may be indicative of their creation order, or may be due to some other modelling pipeline quirk.
These start from 701 for those introduced in gen 6, and 801 for those in gen 7, albeit in a different order form the national dex ordering, and skipping a large amount of numbers between gens.
The highest numbered ID for each gen is also higher than the total count for the gen, leaving a few gaps.
The missing IDs are 750 and 771 for gen 6, and 864 and 870 for gen 7, not including the possibility of reallocated IDs.
These unused IDs may also imply the possibility of cuts during development, although this is speculation.

The new nut Pokémon has the asset ID 891, which is close to the currently last used asset ID of 888 for Zeraora, and so groups it with gen 7 asset IDs,
This may also imply the possibility of two more entries at 889 and 890 to also be introduced in LGPE.

Following this precedent, gen 8 is likely to use species IDs starting from 901.


The form IDs refer to similar kinds of form across different species.

_01				Female gender difference  
_11 to _30, _37	All other forms, same order as the species' form index sequence  
_51				Mega, Mega X  
_52				Mega Y  
_61				Regional variant
